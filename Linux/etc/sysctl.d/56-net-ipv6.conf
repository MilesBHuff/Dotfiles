## You can uncomment this if you don't need IPv6, but you're better-off disabling it super-early, at the kernel commandline.
# net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1

## Redirects
## Generally, disable redirects unless you're on a PC.
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_redirects=1
## Routers enable, everyone else disable.
