Miles's Dotfiles
================================================================================

About
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| A repository containing many of my personal configs, for both GNU/Linux and
  Windows; but primarily focused on the former.

| There may eventually be considerable overlap between this repository, and my
  [Optimality Theme](https://github.com/MilesBHuff/Optimality) repository.
  Generally speaking, the latter is going to be a subset of the former, and will
  contain only a minimal amount of settings -- those that are necessary to for
  the Optimality theme to work.

  bits of files) that I did not make myself, *should* be indicated as such;
  these such bits may have a different license than below; the only files for
  which the licenses are truly known are non-code, and files with their licenses
  indicated in a comment.   Should you find that anything in my dotfiles is
  incompatible with the LGPL3 or CC BY-SA 4.0 (depending upon the filetype),
  please let me know, and I will rewrite the component(s) in-question.  I aim
