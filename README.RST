Miles's Dotfiles
================================================================================

About
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| A repository containing many of my personal configs, for both GNU/Linux and
  Windows; but primarily focused on the former.

| Note that, out of necessity, there is some overlap between this repository and
  that of my theme, [Optimality](https://github.com/MilesBHuff/Optimality).
  Generally speaking, though, I try to separate concerns between the two repos,
  with this one focusing on non-theme configs, and the latter focusing on theme
  configs.
