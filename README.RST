Miles's Dotfiles
================================================================================

About
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| A repository containing many of my personal configs, for both GNU/Linux and
  Windows; but primarily focused on the former.

| (Note that, out of necessity, there is some overlap between this repository and
  that of my theme, `Optimality`_. Generally speaking, though, I try to separate
  concerns between the two repos, with this one focusing on non-theme configs,
  and the latter focusing on theme configs.)

| As much as possible, I have tried to create all these files myself. Files (and
  bits of files) that I did not make myself, *should* be indicated as such;
  these such bits may have a different license than below; the only files for
  which the licenses are truly known are non-code, and files with their licenses
  indicated in a comment.   Should you find that anything in my dotfiles is
  incompatible with the LGPL3 or CC BY-SA 4.0 (depending upon the filetype),
  please let me know, and I will rewrite the component(s) in-question.  I aim
