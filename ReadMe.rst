Miles's GNU/Linux Dotfiles/Rice
################################################################################

About
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
| A repository containing some of my GNU/Linux configs.  Currently, there are
  only a handful;  but I'd like to eventually get the majority of my configs
  uploaded.
| The files in this repository are generally intended for an Arch Linux system,
  although many of the files have been written with multiple distros in-mind.
| There is going to be considerable overlap between this repository, and my
  Optimal Theme repository.  Generally speaking, the latter is going to be a
  subset of the former, and will contain only a minimal amount of settings --
  those that are necessary to for the Optimal theme to work.
