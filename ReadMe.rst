About
================================================================================
| A repository containing some of my GNU/Linux configs.  Currently, there are
  only a hanful;  but I'd like to eventually get the majority of my configs
  uploaded.
| My configs are generally intended for an Arch Linux system.

License

| As much as possible, I have tried to create all these configs myself.
