About
================================================================================
| A repository containing some of my GNU/Linux configs.  Currently, there are
  only a handful;  but I'd like to eventually get the majority of my configs
  uploaded.
| The files in this repository are generally intended for an Arch Linux system.
| Where possible, I'm trying to separate personal config files from theme files
  (The latter of which belong in my Optimal Theme repository.).
